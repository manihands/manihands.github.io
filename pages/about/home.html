Hello!! I'm Yenny! My pronouns are she/her/hers. I'm an easily-distracted human being who is concurrently jaded and starry-eyed at the mysteries of life. 
</br></br>
I'm excited to have finally built a living, personal website as a place to showcase some of mani things that I am excited and passionate about, free from any direct ties to variations of superficial clout measured by likes and views.

To whomever's eyes are reading this - welcome!
