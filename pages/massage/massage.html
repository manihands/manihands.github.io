I studied bodywork through the Integrative Massage & Bodywork Practitioner (IMBP) Program at the wonderful <a class="text-reddish-6 hover:text-reddish-3" href="https://www.mylei.org/">IPSB at Life Energy Institute</a> in Culver City, CA.

<br>
<br>In August 2020 I finally received my certification to practice massage in the city of Los Angeles through the California Massage Therapy Council (CAMTC)! You can verify my status <a class="text-reddish-6 hover:text-reddish-3" href="https://www.camtc.org/record-search?certificateNumber=84794&work=Los+Angeles&lastName=Zhang&firstName=Yenny"> here</a>.

    My practice is currently only open to friends and family due to COVID. I use swedish, myofascial, sports massage, and deep tissue modalities.
